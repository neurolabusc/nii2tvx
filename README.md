# nii2tvx

`nii2tvx` is a command-line tool for estimating structural disconnection from voxel-based lesion maps.
It creates **TVX** files from streamline data (`.trk` or `.tck`) and computes overlap between binary lesion masks and TVX files.  
By identifying which fiber bundles are intersected by lesions, it highlights likely disruptions to white matter pathways and their relation to impairment and recovery.

## Features

- Convert streamline files (`.trk` or `.tck`) to compact `.tvx` format.  
- Compute the fraction of streamlines intersecting a lesion mask.  
- Supports `.nii` and `.nii.gz` NIfTI images.  
- Handles both TRK and TCK tractography formats.  

## Manual Usage

### 0. Compile nii2tvx

Clone and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neurolabusc/nii2tvx
cd nii2tvx
make
```

### 1. Create TVX files from streamline data

```bash
./nii2tvx template.nii tracks1.tck tracks2.tck
./nii2tvx template.nii tracks1.trk
```

- `template.nii`: NIfTI image defining voxel space and affine transform.  
- `tracksX.trk` / `tracksX.tck`: tractography files.  
- Output: `.tvx` files, one per input streamline file.  
- Pack many into one self-describing atlas: `./nii2tvx -p atlas.tvx tracks1.tvx tracks2.tvx`  
- Format details: [tvx_format.md](tvx_format.md).  

### 2. Compute lesion overlaps with TVX files

```bash
./nii2tvx lesion.nii atlas.tvx
./nii2tvx lesion1.nii lesion2.nii tracks1.tvx tracks2.tvx
./nii2tvx ./imgs/w*lesion.nii.gz atlas.tvx > results.tsv
```

- `lesionX.nii`: binary lesion masks.  
- `atlas.tvx` / `tracksX.tvx`: precomputed TVX files, one column per tract they contain.  
- Output: TSV table of lesion–tract overlap fractions.  

## Automated TVX creation

The script `hcp2tvx.py` downloads the [HCP1065 Population-Averaged Tractography Atlas](https://brain.labsolver.org/hcp_trk_atlas.html) TRK files and converts them to match the template `MNI152_T1_1mm_brain_mask.nii.gz`.  
You can adapt the script for other templates or streamlines.

```bash
python hcp2tvx.py
```

This creates one `tvx` file per tract in `hcp1065_avg_tracts_tvx/` and packs them all into `hcp1065_avg_tracts.tvx`.  
Use `lesion2tvx.py` to compute overlaps, providing a folder of TVX files and a folder of lesions:

```bash
python lesion2tvx.py ./lesions ./hcp1065_avg_tracts_tvx > results.tsv
```


## Example Usage

Consider the provided lesion map `wM2208_T1w_lesion.nii.gz` that has been spatially normalized to the `MNI152_T1_1mm_brain_mask.nii.gz` template. We can identify the proportion damage to all the HCP1065 tracts.

```
nii2tvx ./example/wM2208_T1w_lesion.nii.gz hcp1065_avg_tracts.tvx > M2208.tsv
```
This will generate a tab-separated values file.



## Output Format

Example TSV table:

```
id    tract1    tract2    ...
lesion1    0.25    0.10    ...
lesion2    0.30    0.05    ...
```

- `id`: lesion identifier.  
- Remaining columns: fraction of streamlines intersecting each tract.  

## Build Instructions

Optimized build:

```bash
gcc -O3 nii2tvx.c -o nii2tvx -lz -lm
```

Or use the Makefile:

```bash
make          # optimized build
make sanitize # ASan + UBSan build as nii2tvx_asan
make wasm     # nii2tvx.mjs + nii2tvx.wasm (needs emcc); try: node wasm_demo.mjs lesion.nii.gz atlas.tvx
```

## WebAssembly

The query core has no file I/O, so it compiles to a 19 KB WASM module exposing six functions (open, count, name, mask, query, close). A page fetches one packed atlas and gunzips it and the lesion in JavaScript; see `wasm_demo.mjs` for the calls.

## Why use nii2tvx?

Other toolkits exist, but `nii2tvx` offers flexibility (easy atlas building) and speed (compact binary format for fast computations).
